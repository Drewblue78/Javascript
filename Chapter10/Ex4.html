<!-- When playing Scrabble, one of the most useful things to memorize is the list of 
all legal two-letter words. It is easy to use the English lexicon to create a list
of two-letter words, but there are at least two strategies for doing so. The most
natural one is to iterate through the words in the lexicon and print those whose
length is two. A somewhat less obvious strategy is to generate all 26
( 26 combinations of the letters and see which ones are words. Implement 
each of these strategies and then use the elapsedTime function from the 
preceding exercise to see which strategy is more efficient. -->
